# raw
A header-only C++ library for handling the GUPPI Raw Data Format.

Developed for C++ 11, with no other dependencies. CMake is used to run the tests.

This code is basically parts stitched together from [rawspec](https://github.com/UCBerkeleySETI/rawspec) and [hashpipe](https://github.com/MydonSolutions/hashpipe).
