# raw
A header-only C++ library for handling the GUPPI Raw Data Format.

Developed for C++ 11, with no other runtime dependencies. For testing you need CMake 3.10 or better.

This code is basically parts stitched together from [rawspec](https://github.com/UCBerkeleySETI/rawspec) and [hashpipe](https://github.com/MydonSolutions/hashpipe).

To run the tests:

```
./run_tests.sh
```
